## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned to leverage CSS custom properties to easily change between different app/color themes.
- I learned to translate a defined algorithm into code, namely the custom expression evaluation logic.

### Continued development

Apply users prefered color theme and save additional theme changes for the next visit.
